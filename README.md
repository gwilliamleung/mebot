# My First Attempts at using OpenAI's API MeBot

I made this project because I believe using a project based learning approach is the best way to learn. Initially, I developed the chat bot using text-davinci-003, which excels in singular language task (check comments for code history), and then used GPT-3.5 to create a chat bot with chat completion, allowing it to remember what the user previously said and expand on it. This experience allowed me to learn much more about OpenAI's API, their software and their limitations. 

Here is a demo of the latest verison of MeBot currently running on gpt-3.5-turbo
