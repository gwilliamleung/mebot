# My First Attempts at using OpenAI's API MeBot

First, I created a chat bot using text-davinci-003, which excels in singular language task, and then I used GPT-3.5 to create a chat bot with chat completion, it remembers what has been previously said. I made this project because I believe using a project based learning approach is the best way to learn. Because of this, I was able to learn much more about OpenAI's API, their software and their limitations. 

Here is a demo of the latest verison of MeBot currently running on gpt-3.5-turbo
